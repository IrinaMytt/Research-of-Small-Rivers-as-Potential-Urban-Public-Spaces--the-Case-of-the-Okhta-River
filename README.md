## Project Overview

This repository contains the materials and files creating for the Master’s thesis titled **"Research of Small Rivers as Potential Urban Public Spaces: the Case of the Okhta River"**. The research aims to develop and test a methodological approach for evaluating the small urban rivers in terms of their potential to be transformed into successful and sustainable public spaces.
Focusing on the case of the **Okhta River in Saint Petersburg**, the study addresses the broader issue of underutilization of small rivers in urban environments and their potential contribution to city sustainability, social inclusion, and ecological restoration. 
The object of the research is the urban small rivers.
The subject of the research is the comprehensive incorporation of small urban rivers into public spaces.
The goal of the research is to develop	an approach	for assessing the potential of small rivers as urban public spaces	and design recommendations for their effective integration into	the urban environment. 
The objectives of the research are:
a)	Review theoretical and practical approaches to studying urban water infrastructure and its transformation into public spaces;
b)	Analyze existing methods for assessing small rivers as public spaces, identifying their strengths and limitations;
c)	Develop a methodological framework for evaluating small rivers as urban public spaces, specifying key parameters and assessment criteria;
d)	Apply the developed method to the Okhta River, conducting an empirical assessment of its potential as a public space; 
e)	Analyze the results of the case study and identify spatial, environmental, and social factors influencing the integration of small rivers into the urban structure; 
f)	Develop recommendations for improving the role of small rivers in the urban fabric, considering planning, policy, and management strategies.

## Description of Data and Method

### Source Data

The method was tested using real spatial, environmental, and social data related to the Okhta River. The source data includes:
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** layers for infrastructure and natural features,
- **Sociological data** collected from public opinion surveys regarding public space preferences,
- **Environmental indicators** such as water pollution levels, biodiversity presence, air pollution from official reports,
- **Safety Metrics** from police reports,
- **Municipal planning documentation and existing urban development programs**.

### Method Description

The developed approach combines spatial analysis, non-spatial analysis of the area, and sociological evaluation to identify the most promising locations and configurations for revitalizing small rivers as public spaces. The method includes:
- A **PSQ Index** (Public Space Quality Index) evaluating spatial accessibility, safety, environmental metrics, and facilities available;
- A **Sociological Survey** to get more quantitative data, initiate public engagement, analyse needs and preferences of residents, get more redesigning ideas, correlate this data with spatial and non-spatial analysis results gathered.
